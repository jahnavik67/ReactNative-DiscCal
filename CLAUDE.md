# Claude Code Session Context - Discount Calculator

## Project Overview
- **App Name**: Discount Calculator
- **Platform**: React Native (Android focus)
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/jahnavik67/ReactNative-DiscCal
- **Project Path**: C:\DC (Windows) / /mnt/c/DC (WSL)

## Recent Work Completed

### Layout Responsiveness Fix (Latest Session)
**Problem**: Layout looked different on Pixel 9 vs Pixel 4 - Pixel 9 showed everything on one screen without scrolling, Pixel 4 had proper scrolling behavior.

**Solution Applied**: Modified `DiscountCalculatorScreen.tsx` with:
- Added `Dimensions` import for responsive sizing
- Set `minHeight: Dimensions.get('window').height * 0.9` to force scroll behavior
- Enabled `showsVerticalScrollIndicator={true}` and `alwaysBounceVertical={true}`
- Improved content structure with `mainContent` wrapper and flex layout
- Enhanced button positioning with proper padding

**Files Modified**:
- `/mnt/c/DC/src/components/calculator/DiscountCalculatorScreen.tsx`

## Current Issues

### Environment Setup Problems - RESOLVED (July 21, 2025)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Environment issues resolved

**Root Cause Identified**: 
- Android SDK auto-updated over the weekend (timestamps show July 21 updates)
- User had conflicting JAVA_HOME variables:
  - User Variables: JDK 11 (old/incorrect)
  - System Variables: JDK 17 (correct)
- React Native was picking up wrong JDK version

**Issues Found and Fixed**:
- ✅ JDK version: JDK 17.0.16 installed and configured
- ✅ Android SDK: Version 35.0.0 found and working
- ✅ Environment variables: Configured in gradle.properties and local.properties
- ⏳ Final step: Remove conflicting User JAVA_HOME variable

**Previous Error**:
```
ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory
error Failed to install the app. Command failed with exit code 255
```

## Key Commands Used
```bash
# Run Android app
npm run android

# Check environment
npx react-native doctor

# Git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

## Work Completed Today (July 21, 2025)
1. ✅ Diagnosed Android SDK auto-update issue from weekend
2. ✅ Found and configured JDK 17.0.16 installation
3. ✅ Updated gradle.properties with JDK 17 path
4. ✅ Updated android/local.properties with correct SDK and Java paths
5. ✅ Identified conflicting User JAVA_HOME variable issue

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Fixed gradle.properties and local.properties path format (changed from \\ to /)
2. ⏳ Need to run npm run android from Windows PowerShell (not WSL) due to gradle Windows path requirements
3. Test the responsive layout changes on both Pixel 4 and Pixel 9  
4. Build and publish new version to Google Play Console for closed testing

## Critical Finding
- React Native Android builds must be run from Windows PowerShell, not WSL
- Gradle expects Windows-style environment variables and paths
- WSL environment variables are not accessible to Windows gradle process

## App Publishing
- Previous version already published to Google Play Console for closed testing
- Need to increment version code for new release with layout fixes

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows with WSL2
- **Node**: Working
- **NPM**: Working
- **React Native CLI**: Working
- **Android Device**: Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 4 for testing
